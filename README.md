# Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Detection
## Abstract
> Cancer encompasses more than 200 distinct types, with melanoma being the most lethal form of skin cancer. The diagnostic process for melanoma begins with a clinical assessment, followed by dermoscopic imaging and histopathological analysis. If detected in its early stages, melanoma is highly treatable. The initial step in diagnosing melanoma is performing a visual inspection of the affected skin area. Dermatologists capture dermatoscopic images of skin lesions using a high-resolution camera, which provides an accuracy range of 65-80% in identifying melanoma without additional technical assistance. Through further visual assessment by oncologists and analysis of dermatoscopic images, the overall diagnostic accuracy of melanoma increases to 75-84%. This project aims to develop an automated classification system using image processing techniques to identify skin cancer from images of skin lesions.

## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.

The data set contains the following diseases:
